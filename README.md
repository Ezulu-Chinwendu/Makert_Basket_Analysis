# Makert_Basket_Analysis
I conducted a market basket analysis to delve into customer purchasing behavior within the project. By scrutinizing patterns, I pinpointed product combinations commonly bought together. This analysis equips the organization with valuable insights to enhance sales strategies and bolster customer satisfaction. The dataset encompassed 38,765 rows across 3 columns.

2. Enhanced Product Pages: Highlight related items on individual product pages ('Soda' and 'Whole Milk') to increase visibility and encourage exploration.
3. Checkout & Cart Optimization: Recommend complementary items during checkout and offer discounts for associated products to drive additional purchases ('Sausage', 'Yogurt', 'Other Vegetables').
4. Dynamic Page Elements: Utilize user behavior data to personalize item placements and curate themed collections ('Whole Milk' and 'Soda') for targeted campaigns.
